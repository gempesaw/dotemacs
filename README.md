dotemacs
======

my .emacs.d folder with all of my customizations

Installation
======

There are a couple different ways this can be done, but what works for me is the following:

    git clone git://github.com/gempesaw/dotemacs.git directory-of-your-choosing
    ln -s directory-of-your-choosing ~/.emacs.d

Information
======

These configurations currently come from three main places:

1. Things I like and have gotten used to over the years
2. Ryan McGeary's [Working with OS X and Emacs](http://how-i-work.com/workbenches/30-working-with-os-x-and-emacs)
3. Bozhidar's Batsov's [emacs-prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude)
