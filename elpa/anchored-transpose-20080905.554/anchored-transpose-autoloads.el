Transpose portions of the region around an anchor phrase.

`this phrase but not that word'    can be transposed into
`that word but not this phrase'

I want this phrase but not that word.
       |----------------------------|. .This is the entire phrase.
                  |-------|. . . . . . .This is the anchor phrase.

First select the entire phrase and type \\[anchored-transpose].  Then select
the anchor phrase and type \\[anchored-transpose] again.  By default the
anchor phrase will automatically include any surrounding whitespace even if
you don't explicitly select it.  Also, it won't include certain trailing
punctuation.  See `anchored-transpose-do-fuzzy' for details.  A prefix arg
prior to either selection means `no fuzzy logic, use selections literally'.

You can select the anchor phrase first followed by the entire phrase if more
convenient.  Typing \\[anchored-transpose] with nothing selected clears any
prior selection.  If both primary and secondary selections are active this
command swaps the 2 selections immediately.

I want this phrase but not that word.
       |----------|       |---------|   Separate phrase selection.

You can also select the phrases to be swapped separately in any order.
